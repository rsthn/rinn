# Rinn Library

This library provides functionality for classes, models, collections, events, and serialization (with strict schemas) that might not be ground-breaking but are certainly pretty useful.

<br/>

## Installation

Use your favorite package manager, or just download the standalone files from the `dist` folder and include it in your index.html file.

```sh
pnpm add rinn
```
