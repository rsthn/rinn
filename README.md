# Rinn Library

This library provides functionality for classes, models, collections, events, and serialization (with schemas) that might not be ground-breaking but are certainly pretty useful.

<br/>

## Installation

You can use npm to install the library, or download the standalone `rinn.js` file from the `dist` folder and include it in your index.html file, in the latter case an object named 'Rinn' or 'rinn' will be available in the global scope.

```sh
yarn add rinn
```
