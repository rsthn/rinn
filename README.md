# Rinn Library

This library provides functionality for classes, models, collections, events, and serialization (with schemas) that might not be ground-breaking but are certainly pretty useful.

<br/>

## Installation

You can use npm/yarn to install the library, or just download the standalone files `rinn.js` (ESM) or `rinn.cjs.js` (CommonJS) from the `dist` folder and include it in your index.html file directly. When using CJS, a global variable named `rinn` will be available.

```sh
yarn add rinn
```
