# Rinn Library

This library provides functionality for classes, models, collections, events, and serialization (with strict schemas) that might not be ground-breaking but are certainly pretty useful.

<br/>

## Installation

You can use npm/yarn to install the library, or just download the standalone file (ESM) from the `dist` folder and include it in your index.html file.

```sh
yarn add rinn
```
